# 🎮 Upper!

**Upper!** is a video game developed as a personal project for an academic assignment. Built with Unity and C#, this game represents one of my first complete and functional game development experiences.

It is a **local multiplayer game for up to 4 players**, where participants compete to climb a descending tower of platforms inside a factory. If you fall, you're out. The last player standing wins.
